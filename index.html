            <p>
                Face processing depends on a complex network of brain regions, and dysfunction within this network can produce a wide variety of face processing impairments. When faces or parts of faces are perceived as distorted, the condition is known as <b>prosopometamorphopsia (PMO)</b>. “Prosopo” comes from the Greek word for face <em>prosopon</em> while “metamorphopsia” refers to perceptual distortions.

            <p>
                Not surprisingly, people with prosopometamorphopsia (PMO) often find it disturbing to look at other people’s faces. Fortunately, most cases last only a few days or weeks, but in some people, face distortions sometimes last for many years. Around 75 cases reports on people with PMO have been published, so the condition appears to be quite rare.

                Prosopometamorphopsia (PMO) comes in different forms. The condition causes features to appear distorted in a variety of ways -- they may droop, appear smaller or larger than normal, be out of position, or seem stretched. PMO is typically classified based on the region of the face that is affected by distortion.  We currently have little understanding about why people experience different types of PMO, but it is one of the many questions that we are interested in investigating.

            <p>
                Little is known about the different types of prosopometamorphopsia (PMO) because few cases have been studied. <a href="https://lab.faceblind.org">Our lab</a> is very interested in studying people with PMO. We hope that our research can lead to a deeper understanding of PMO and also how face processing works in typical brains. In addition, this research may help us identify interventions that reduce or eliminate face distortions in PMO.
